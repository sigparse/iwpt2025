### Paper Submissions

IWPT 2025 welcomes electronic submissions (as PDF files) through the following submission page:  
<https://openreview.net/group?id=SyntaxFest/2025>

When submitting, authors will be asked to indicate which workshops they wish
their paper to be considered for and to specify whether their submission
is archival or non-archival.

### Submission Format

When submitting, authors will be asked to indicate which workshops they wish
their paper to be considered for and to specify whether their submission
is archival or non-archival.

All submissions should follow the two-column ACL style guidelines. We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files, OpenDocument, or Microsoft Word templates created for ACL: https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files. All papers must be anonymous, i.e., not reveal author(s) on the title page or through self-references. So, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 2020) …”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (2020) previously showed …”.


For more information, please see the [call for papers](/cfp).
